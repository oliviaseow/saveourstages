# The story

Live performance events have been postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic. This is our teamâ€™s quirky tribute to the performing arts, crew, and community, bringing the stage to you and your home. We were inspired by the Save Our Stages movement, and the social and performance-based nature of Instagram Reels. Our team learned how to collaborate remotely, the new features of SparkAR, and faced challenges such as simplifying a complex concept into an elegant idea.
